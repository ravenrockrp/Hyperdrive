# Hyperdrive
Hyperdrive is a system which allows you to set up transportation zones or NPCs (any npc model) to facilitate fast travel.

Fast travel functions similarly to carts in Skyrim. The zone or NPC is provided with a list of coordinates or other zones it is allowed to travel to and a price for going to each one. Price can be calculated automatically by linear distance if provided a rate. 

Global transport zones/NPCs are possible too, which will allow transportation to all configured zones, not just the ones configured.
